**`Chapter Two - Homelab history:`**
<br> <br>
**`Why I started my homelab:`**
<br> <br>
I initially started my homelab in 2022 around late october because I wanted to get some hands on experience with networking for my Cisco networking class.
<br> <br>
I learned how to setup many different types of virtual networks in virtualbox and vmware workstation player. Some of the following networks included: bridged, host-only, private, NAT, and internal.
<br> <br>
I mainly used virtualbox as that was the hypervisor I preferred using. I started experimenting with different operating systems such as fedora linux and ubuntu, yet I didn't really have a clue how they worked or how to properly use them.
<br> <br>
It wasn't until my second semester of college until I really started making a more interesting homelab. I started taking a linux system administration course that inspired me to create a virtualized ubuntu server outside of the course.
<br> <br>
I used that operating system to learn things such as the vim text editor alongside so in the linux system admin course. I also learned how to setup SFTP and interact with a file server using Filezilla. SFTP was the first service I setup.
<br> <br>
The next service I started was HTTP, this was around january 2023. I setup a small website that told the current military time and had links to youtube as well as my textbooks, and school website.
<br> <br>
Throughout the next couple of months I experimented heavy with virtualization and my homelab. I started installing more uncommon operating systems such as templeos, Arch etc. to learn more about different operating systems
