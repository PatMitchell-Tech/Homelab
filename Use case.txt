My homelab has been used for many different things.
I will list some reasons below on what I have used mine for.
1. Setting up encrypted file servers and clients using ssh and filezilla for SFTP
2. Setting up and configuring docker on my rpi4 to run certain services isolated in containers
3. Setting up a domain controller in active directory and connecting five virtual machines to the domain
4. Experimenting with penetration testing and learning how to exploit and defend against attacks
5. Running services that I use on a daily basis such as pi-hole
